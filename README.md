## About <a name = "about"></a>
This repo presents a computational approach to design high-level interlocking puzzles. We implemented our computational design tool in C++ and `libigl` [Jacobson et al. 2018] on a desktop computer with 3.6 GHz 8-Core Intel processor and 16 GB RAM. 

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
Our code can be ran on MacOS and Unbuntu (Linux) system. First clone the repository, run CMake to generate Makefiles or CMake/Visual Studio project files, and the rest should just work automatically.

<!-- ### Prerequisites
We need to install `cgal` before running our code. With the help of `brew`, we can easily get `cgal`.

```
brew install cgal
``` -->

### Compilation

- **MacOS and Ubuntu(Linux)**:

```
$ cd [current folder path]
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j 16
```
The integer following make -j is the number of threads supported by your CPU architecture. Replace it with your optimal value.

- **Windows**: currently unavailable.


## GUI Interface <a name = "usage"></a>
The control panel is shown below. There are 6 components in the control panel: **Parameter Control**, **Status Bar**, **High Level Puzzle Constructor**, **Modify High Level Puzzle**, **Assembly State Viewer** and **Render Control**.

</p>

- ### Parameter Control

  `Piece Number`  Determine the number of pieces *K*.
  
  `Level of Difficulty` Determine the level of difficulty *L*. The program will keep running until constructing a puzzle with level of difficulty equal or higher than *L*.
  
  `Seed Number` With the same seed number, users can regenerate the same puzzle as before.
  
  `Puzzle Tolerance` This parameter is set for fabrication only, which can control the gap between pieces.

- ### High Level Puzzle Constructor

  `Read` Our program can read 2 types of input files: *.puz* and *.vol* file. 

  `Construct` Construct the *K* piece level-*L* puzzle with given import volume.

  `Save Puz` Save puzzle generated by our program.

  `Reset` Reset all parameters. 
  
- ### Modify High Level Puzzle

  `Target Level (Modify)` The target level after modifying current puzzle.

  `Modifying` Start modifying currrent puzzle. 

- ### Assembly State Viewer

  `Disassembly Step` Determine the disassembly step.

  `Prev` Previous disassembly step.

  `Next` Next disassembly step.

- ### Render Control
  Control the object visualization state.
  
- ### Status Bar

  `Puzzle State` Indicate state (e.g. interlocking and deadlocking) of current puzzle.

  `Level of Difficulty` Level of difficult of current puzzle.

## Create a level-12 Cube Puzzle by Yourself ! <a name = "create_puzzle"></a>
These instructions gives an example to you of how to use our code to generate high-level interlocking puzzle by yourself. To generate high-level interlocking puzzles efficiently, it is usually necessary to modify the puzzle pieces. For example, to generate a level-12 cube puzzle, we first constrct a level-6 cube puzzle and modify it to level-12 puzzle; see *Section 4* in our paper for detailed explanation of construction and modifying algorithm.

### Step 1: import a volume
Import a Cube_5x5x5_E1.vol volume file by clicking `read` button.

</p>

### Step 2: create a level-6 cube puzzle
Set the `Level of Difficulty` as 6 and click the `Construct` button to create a piece-4 level-6 cube puzzle.

</p>

### Step 3: modifying to reach a level-12 puzzle
Set the `Target Level (Modify)` as 12 and click the `Modify` button to start modifying.

### Step 4: visualize disassembly steps
Click the `Next` to visualize how to disassemble the current puzzle.

</p>

### Step 5: save puzzle for fabrication
Set the `Puzzle Tolerance` greater than 0 to create gaps between pieces. Here we suggest to set 0.005. Lastly, you can click `Save Puz` to save the *.puz* file and *.obj* files of each piece that can be used for fabrication.
